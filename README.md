 - Natural
 - Artificial
 - Activations
     - Binary Step
     - Sigmoid = 1 / 1-e^-x
     - TanH
 - Structure
     - Neuron, Bias
     - Dentrite
     - Layer
 - Build int[]
 - Run
     - for every layer, for every neuron
     - value = summation of previous layers value * weight of each previous layers 
     - value = sigmoid(value +_ bias)
